# Crossdart

The generator of the site [http://crossdart.info](Crossdart)

Also, allows to generate metadata for the project, and then use
the Chrome Extension (also included) to add links to the declarations
on Github (for the tree views, and for the pull requests).

It's super pre alpha without any docs yet. Stay tuned :)
